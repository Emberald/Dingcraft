# Dingcraft
###Description
This is the first minecraft mod after my friends and I have learnt Java. The purpose of creating this mod is to practice our programming skill and, most importantly, to have fun.
###Features
* New Arrows
 + _Void arrow_ is enchanted with void energy which penetrates everything, including players in creative mode, triggered by level 2 flame enchantment. 
 + _Fission arrow_ duplicates exponentially, triggered by level 3 flame enchantment, restricted by the level of power enchantment. 
 + _Torch arrow_ places a torch at the target block and produces a dynamic source of lighting, triggered by level 4 flame enchantment. _Good for cave explorers!_ 
* New Blocks
 + _Ding block_ is a creepy block of the face of Albert whose skull is rather square-shaped in real life.
* New Items
 + _Ding wand_ sends a creature to the sky.
