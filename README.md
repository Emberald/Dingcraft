# Dingcraft
###Description
This is the first minecraft mod after my friends and I have learnt Java. The purpose of creating this mod is to practice our programming skill and, of course, to have fun.
###Features
* Extended Enchantment
  * On a bow
    + _Flame_: enchants arrows with void energy which penetrates everything except creatures when the enchantment level is 2, and shoots fission arrows when the enchantment level is at least 3. 
    + _Inifinity_: shoots multiple arrows with their amount increasing as the enchantment level increases. 
* New Blocks
  + _Ding block_: a creepy block of the face of Albert whose skull is rather square-shaped in real life.
* New Items
  + _Ding wand_: knocks a creature and sends it to the sky.
