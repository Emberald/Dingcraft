# Dingcraft
###Discription
This is the first minecraft mod after my friends and I have learnt Java. The purpose of creating this mod is to practice our programming skill and, of course, to have fun.
###Features
* Extended Enchantment
  * On a bow
    + _Flame_: enchants arrows with void energy which penetrates everything except creatures when the enchantment level of flame is at least 2. 
    + _Inifinity_: shoots multiple arrows with their amount increasing as the enchantment level of infinity increases. 
* New Blocks
  + _Ding Block_: a creepy block of the face of Albert whose head is rather square-shaped in real life.
* New items
  + _Ding Wand_: knocks a creature and sends it to the sky.
